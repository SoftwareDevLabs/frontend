# Code Organization

## Rules

- **Follow the pattern of what you already see in the code**
- Try to package new ideas/components into libraries that have nicely defined interfaces
- Package new ideas into classes or refactor existing ideas into a class as you extend
- Each project should have a Unit test in a ut_ folder in its subdirectory (like `ut_host`)
- Functional tests should be in ft_ subdirectories (like `ft_api`)
- Build scripts are generally in subdirectories with their type of output (like `/dll` or `/exe`)
- Try to place interfaces in an `inc` folder in an appropriate location
- Structure related libraries together (`/softwareModule/parser` and `/softwareModule/adapter`)

## Code Overview
* `/` - root is where solution files, root MD documentation, SD replication artifacts go.
* `/bin` – not checked in is where binaries will be generated by the Build system
* `/dep` – dependencies that aren’t a part of the SDK
* `/obj` – not checked in is where objects will be generated by the Build system
* `/src` – This is the fun one. In the root is common build system data

## File Overview

* Overview of the functionality covered by particular file
	* `Filename1.cpp`
	* `Filename2.py`
* Overview of the functionality covered by particular file
	* `Filename3.js`
	* `Filename4.ts`
