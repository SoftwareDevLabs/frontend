## Software Module Roadmap

The plan for the Software Module [is described here](/doc/roadmap-2023.md) and
will be updated as the project proceeds.

## Software Module Overview

Please take a few minutes to review the overview below before diving into the
code:

### Key Component 1



### Key Component 2



### Shared Components

## Frontend

Frontend-related code is kept under the `frontend/` directory at the repository root. This includes the Web interface and dashboard. The frontend is implemented with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and uses the Socket.IO client for real-time communication.

## Documentation

All project documentation is located at [softwaremodule-docs](./doc/). If you would like
to contribute to the documentation, please submit a pull request on the [Software Module
Documentation](https://github.com/SoftwareDevLabs).

## 🔧 Key Components

```

📁 config/ → YAML config for models, prompts, logging
📁 data/ → Prompts, embeddings, and other dynamic content
📁 examples/ → Minimal scripts to test key features
📁 notebooks/ → Quick experiments and prototyping
📁 tests/ → Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
📁 frontend/ → Web UI and dashboard (React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Socket.IO). See [README](./frontend/README.md)
📁 src/ → The core engine — all logic lives here (./src/README.md)

```

## ⚡ Best Practices

- Track prompt versions and results  
- Separate configs using YAML files
- Maintain separation between model clients
- Structure code by clear module boundaries  
- Cache responses to reduce latency and cost  
- Handle errors with custom exceptions  
- Use notebooks for rapid testing and iteration  
- Monitor API usage and set rate limits  
- Keep code and docs in sync  

---

## 🧭 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo  
2. Install via `requirements.txt`  
3. Set up model configs  
4. Check sample code  
5. Begin in notebooks

## 💡 Development Tips

- Use modular structure  
- Test components early  
- Track with version control  
- Keep datasets fresh  
- Keep documentation updated
- Monitor API usage and limits
